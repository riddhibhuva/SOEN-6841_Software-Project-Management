\section{Abstract}
This report revisits the critical insights from Venkat Subramaniam’s "Value Results, Not Just Effort," which challenges the traditional software development culture that often equates extended effort and long hours with higher productivity. Subramaniam presents a compelling argument that this misplaced emphasis can lead to inefficiency and project bloat, much like overwatering can damage rather than nurture a plant. Through the metaphor of a maple tree suffering from too much water, he illustrates the potential harm of excessive effort in software development practices.\\

Subramaniam delineates two distinct management styles: one that rewards long working hours, and another that prioritizes traditional work schedules focused on the timely completion of deliverables. He demonstrates how the latter, a results-oriented approach, cultivates a more productive, efficient, and ultimately more successful work environment \cite{Verbeeten2015}. The study highlights the issue of superfluous code, often written under the guise of 'extensibility', which can lead to unnecessary complexity and project delays \cite{WagnerDeissenboeck2019}.\\

The case study serves as a catalyst for questioning and potentially overhauling entrenched norms within the software development industry. Subramaniam advocates for a paradigm shift towards valuing tangible, value-driven results rather than the mere input of time and effort. His insights suggest that such a realignment would better serve the long-term objectives and sustainable success of software projects \cite{FayadSchmidt1997}. The enhanced understanding gleaned from this analysis, supported by industry research and best practices, underscores the imperative for a results-oriented approach that is both efficient and adaptive to the evolving demands of the technology landscape \cite{Trendowicz2009, BudacuPocatilu2018}.
